# SQL-UI-project

This project is a continuation of a project from my SQL college course in which I created a SQL database based on a hospital scenario with ajoining
 python code that could run commands from the command line for retrieving data and entering new data into the database. For running the command line UI, please review the instructions.

The future of this project will be taking the old command line based UI and implementing a proper angular-based UI that anyone can use and understand.
The updates for this project will take place in my free time and my goal is to make a polished GUI that will interface with the SQL database to enter and
retrieve data for record keeping, similar to what you may see if you were a receptionist at the pretend hospital whose records are fleshed out 
in my SQL database.
